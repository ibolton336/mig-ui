For more resources and API docs check out [facebook.github.io/flux](https://facebook.github.io/flux).\n\n## How Flux works\n\nFor more information on how Flux works check out the [Flux Concepts](./examples/flux-concepts) guide, or the [In Depth Overview](https://facebook.github.io/flux/docs/in-depth-overview).\n\n## Requirements\nFlux is more of a pattern than a framework, and does not have any hard dependencies.  However, we often use [EventEmitter](https://nodejs.org/api/events.html#events_class_eventemitter) as a basis for `Stores` and [React](https://github.com/facebook/react) for our `Views`.  The one piece of Flux not readily available elsewhere is the `Dispatcher`.  This module, along with some other utilities, is available here to complete your Flux toolbox.\n\n## Installing Flux\nFlux is available as a [npm module](https://www.npmjs.org/package/flux), so you can add it to your package.json file or run `npm install flux`.  The dispatcher will be available as `Flux.Dispatcher` and can be required like this:\n\n```javascript\nconst Dispatcher = require('flux').Dispatcher;\n```\n\nTake a look at the [dispatcher API and some examples](https://facebook.github.io/flux/docs/dispatcher).\n\n## Flux Utils\n\nWe have also provided some basic utility classes to help get you started with Flux. These base classes are a solid foundation for a simple Flux application, but they are **not** a feature-complete framework that will handle all use cases. There are many other great Flux frameworks out there if these utilities do not fulfill your needs.\n\n```js\nimport {ReduceStore} from 'flux/utils';\n\nclass CounterStore extends ReduceStore<number> {\n  getInitialState(): number {\n    return 0;\n  }\n\n  reduce(state: number, action: Object): number {\n    switch (action.type) {\n      case 'increment':\n        return state + 1;\n\n      case 'square':\n        return state * state;\n\n      default:\n        return state;\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nCheck out the [examples](./examples) and [documentation](https://facebook.github.io/flux/docs/flux-utils) for more information.\n\n## Building Flux from a Cloned Repo\nClone the repo and navigate into the resulting `flux` directory.  Then run `npm install`.\n\nThis will run [Gulp](https://gulpjs.com/)-based build tasks automatically and produce the file Flux.js, which you can then require as a module.\n\nYou could then require the Dispatcher like so:\n\n```javascript\nconst Dispatcher = require('path/to/this/directory/Flux').Dispatcher;\n```\n\nThe build process also produces de-sugared versions of the `Dispatcher` and `invariant` modules in a `lib` directory, and you can require those modules directly, copying them into whatever directory is most convenient for you.  The flux-todomvc and flux-chat example applications both do this.\n\n## Join the Flux community\nSee the [CONTRIBUTING](/CONTRIBUTING.md) file for how to help out.\n\n## License\nFlux is BSD-licensed. We also provide an additional patent grant.\n",
