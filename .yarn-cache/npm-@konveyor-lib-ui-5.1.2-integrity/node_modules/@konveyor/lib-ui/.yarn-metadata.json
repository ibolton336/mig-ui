    "readme": "# @konveyor/lib-ui\n\nReusable React components, hooks, and TypeScript modules shared between Konveyor UI projects.\n\nThis library exists as a place to store and reuse abstractions that are useful for multiple Konveyor UI projects, and are either not available in PatternFly yet or not covered by PatternFly's scope.\n\nThe React components in this library are compositions and extensions of [patternfly-react](https://github.com/patternfly/patternfly-react) components, and we should avoid duplicating components that are available there.\n\n[![semantic-release](https://img.shields.io/badge/%20%20%F0%9F%93%A6%F0%9F%9A%80-semantic--release-e10079.svg)](https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release)\n\nDocumentation and examples (Storybook): http://konveyor-lib-ui.surge.sh/\n\n## Usage\n\n### Install from npm\n\nIn your app repo, install the library as a normal npm dependency:\n\n```sh\nyarn add @konveyor/lib-ui\n# or:\nnpm install @konveyor/lib-ui\n```\n\n### Install peer dependencies\n\nThis package has React and PatternFly packages as peer dependencies, which are not included in the library bundle. That way, your app can also depend on them directly without bundling them twice.\n\nWhen you install @konveyor/lib-ui, you should get a warning from your package manager telling you which versions to install. [Make sure you have compatible versions](https://github.com/konveyor/lib-ui/blob/main/package.json#L30) as dependencies in your app.\n\n**Note: The `axios` peer dependency is only required if you are using `modules/kube-client`.**\n\n### Optional: Install from local source\n\nIf you need to use an unpublished branch (such as when developing an app PR and a lib-ui PR at the same time), you can reference the dependency directly from your local disk by using `yarn link` or `npm link`.\n\nFirst, clone the lib-ui repo somewhere, `cd` to that clone, install and build the package, and run `yarn link`.\nUnfortunately, you then need to delete `node_modules` in the lib-ui directory so the app's builder doesn't pick it up.\n\n```sh\ngit clone https://github.com/konveyor/lib-ui.git konveyor-lib-ui\ncd konveyor-lib-ui\nyarn install\nyarn build\nyarn link\nrm -rf node_modules\n```\n\nThen, `cd` to the app you're developing, and run `yarn link @konveyor/lib-ui` to install the linked version instead of the npm version.\n\n```sh\ncd ../virt-ui\nyarn link @konveyor/lib-ui\n```\n\nIf you make a change in your local lib-ui clone, reinstall its dependencies, rebuild, and remove them. Your app should then pick up the changes.\n\n```sh\ncd ../konveyor-lib-ui\nyarn install\nyarn build\nrm -rf node_modules\n```\n\nWhen you're done, in your app repo, unlink the package and force a reinstall of the npm version:\n\n```sh\ncd ../virt-ui\nyarn unlink @konveyor/lib-ui\nyarn install --force\n```\n\nThen in the lib-ui directory, run `yarn unlink` if you no longer want it available for linking.\n\n### Use it!\n\nIn your JS/TS, Import named modules from the library, just like PatternFly:\n\n```js\nimport { MyComponent, useSomeHook } from '@konveyor/lib-ui';\n```\n\n---\n\n## Development\n\n### Prerequisites\n\n- [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) >= 10.x\n- [Yarn \"Classic\"](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/lang/en/) (1.x)\n\n### Quick-start\n\nClone and install dependencies:\n\n```sh\ngit clone https://github.com/konveyor/lib-ui.git konveyor-lib-ui\ncd konveyor-lib-ui\nyarn install\n```\n\nRun the [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/) dev server (examples and docs) at http://localhost:6006:\n\n```sh\nyarn storybook\n```\n\n### Scripts\n\nTo run the type-checker, linter and unit tests:\n\n```sh\n# Run all 3:\nyarn ci\n# Or run them individually:\nyarn type-check\nyarn lint [--fix]\nyarn test [--watch]\n```\n\n[Prettier](https://prettier.io/) code formatting is enforced by ESLint. To run Prettier and format your code (do this before committing if you don't run Prettier in your editor):\n\n```sh\nyarn format\n```\n\nTo run a production build using Rollup (outputs to `./dist`):\n\n```sh\nyarn build\n```\n\nTo export the Storybook docs as a static site (outputs to `./storybook-static`):\n\n```sh\nyarn storybook:export\n```\n\n## Triggering an npm release\n\nThis project uses [semantic-release](https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release) via GitHub Actions to automate its npm releases. When a commit is pushed to main, it is checked for specific key words in the commit message to decide whether a release needs to be made, and whether it will be a minor or major version bump. Your commit message will also be added and categorized in the release notes.\n\nTo assist in formatting commit messages correctly for this purpose, the repo is set up for use with [Commitizen](http://commitizen.github.io/cz-cli/), which provides a CLI for guided commit messages.\n\n**To make a commit that should trigger a release**:\n\nFirst, `git add` any changes you want to commit, then:\n\n```sh\nyarn commit\n```\n\nFollow the prompts based on the scope of your commit. **Note: This will generate a message for an individual commit, but since we use squash-and-merge, what matters is your PR title.** If your PR contains multiple commits, please make sure the PR title itself matches the expected format. [See our PR template for more details](https://github.com/konveyor/lib-ui/blob/main/.github/pull_request_template.md).\n\n## File Structure\n\nComponents live in `src/components/MyComponent/` directories, which should each contain:\n\n- `MyComponent.tsx` - component source and type interfaces (types can be their own file if they are verbose enough)\n- `MyComponent.scss` - any custom styles not covered by PatternFly, we should avoid these when possible\n- `MyComponent.stories.mdx` - define your [Storybook stories](https://storybook.js.org/docs/react/get-started/whats-a-story) (examples and docs) for your component. We are using the [MDX story format](https://storybook.js.org/docs/react/writing-docs/mdx). The `title` prop of your story's `<Meta>` defines where it appears in the Storybook nav.\n- Optional: `MyComponent.stories.tsx` - if you need to use TypeScript in the body of your MDX stories, you'll need to define them in a TypeScript file and import them into your MDX file. See existing stories for examples.\n- `MyComponent.test.tsx` - unit tests using [jest](https://jestjs.io/) and [react-testing-library](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro)\n- `index.ts` - define your exports for the component directory\n\nWhen you add a new component, be sure to also export it at the top level (`src/index.ts`).\n\nHooks follow the same structure, but they live under `src/hooks/`.\n",
