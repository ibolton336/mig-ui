If you are using a different web framework and find this module useful, check out [hapi](https://hapi.dev) â€“ they work even better together.\n\n### Visit the [hapi.dev](https://hapi.dev) Developer Portal for tutorials, documentation, and support\n\n## Useful resources\n\n- [Documentation and API](https://hapi.dev/family/bourne/)\n- [Version status](https://hapi.dev/resources/status/#bourne) (builds, dependencies, node versions, licenses, eol)\n- [Changelog](https://hapi.dev/family/bourne/changelog/)\n- [Project policies](https://hapi.dev/policies/)\n- [Free and commercial support options](https://hapi.dev/support/)\n",
